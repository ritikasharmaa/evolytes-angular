      "q1": "Which ages is Evolytes for?",
      "a1": "Evolytes is design for children 5 - 9 years old. These ages are for reference and may vary depending on your child's skill level. \n\n Evolytes works great for all kinds of children who are taking their first steps in maths. Evolytes is very often used by children with learning deficiencies from 6 - 12 years old as it speeds up skill acquisition and provides individualized content in real time. Evolytes has also been used with great results with younger chidlren who are learning to count. If you believe your child is ready to learn maths just go for it! Evolytes will adapt the content to their skill level.\n\nEvolytes is used by children aged 3-16 years old. It all depends on each and every individual although the educational content is designed for children aged 5 - 9 years old.",
      "q2": "Which devices and operating systems is Evolytes compatible with?",
      "a2": "The Evolytes game is currently only compatible with iOS tablets (Apple iPda). In February 2022 we will be releasing a new cross platform version for all iOS and Android devices.\n\n The Evolytes webpage and monitor are compatible with majority of browsers for majority of screen sizes.\n\nEvolytes books are physical books and therefore do not require any devices to use them.",
      "q3": "How does the Evolytes book integration work with the game and Monitor?",
      "a3": "You can only scan QR codes in Evolytes books in the Evolytes mobile game.\n\nOpen the Evolytes game and select the user who owns the book you are using. In the main screen of the game you will see several buttons in the upper right corner. Press the button with the camera icon. It is important to grant the game access to the camera of the device or the game will be unable to scan the QR code. You will need to access your devices settings and give it access to the camera.\n\nNow aim the camera on the QR code which you will scan. When the game has recognized the QR code the gray button in the middle of the screen will turn green. When the button turns green you can press it and you will be prompted with a chapter exam.",
      "q4": "How do I scan a QR code in an Evolytes book?",
      "a4": "Evolytes books integrate with the Evolytes platform through QR codes in the Evolytes mobile game. The QR codes can be found at the end of each chapter in the books. The QR codes can only be scanned in the Evolytes mobile game app. You cannot use the built in camera app to scan the QR code in the books.\n\n Each QR code in the books will test the student's knowledge of the contents of the chapter and if they answer 80% of the questions correctly in the chapter they will get a reward in game for finishing the chapter. This method allows us to positively associated writing skills with positive stimuli of the Evolytes mobile game.\n\nBy logging into the Evolytes platform on the web you can monitor your child's maths progress and their progress in the Evolytes books.",
      "q5": "The camera does not work in the app. How do I fix it?",
      "a5": "If the camera does not work in the Evolytes game it is most likely due to the fact that the app has not been granted access to the device's camera. You will need to exit the game and go to the device's settings to change its access rights.\n\n In Settings you need to find your the Evolytes mobile game in your list of apps and allow it to access the devices camera. When the app has been granted access to the camera you can open the Evolytes game and the camera should work.",
      "q6": "What's unique about Evolytes?",
      "a6": "The Evolytes maths platform is based on unique interdisciplinary research where leading psychological theories were used to speed up student skill acquisition in maths. Prior studies and experiments enabled us to speed up student skill acquisition to make learning faster, more effective while staying fun and engaging.\n\nThe book integration with the Evolytes platform is a unique feature which was developed to ensure student develop reading and writing skills which will improve their learning outcomes and grades.",
      "q7": "What skills does Evolytes practise?",
      "a7": "Evolytes gives your child the foundation they need in mathematics, both phrasing and number sense associated. We regularly add new maths content. Currently we go over the following maths content:\n\nCounting, connecting amounts with numbers.\n\nAddition 1-999\n\nSubtraction 1-999\n\nUnit house, units, tens and hundreds\n\nAddition of multiple parameters\n\nMultiplication\n\nAlgebra\n\nPaterns\n\nComparing sizes (Great than, smaller than, etc...)\n\nForms\n\nDecoding.\n\nWe regularly add new content to the game so this list is not exhaustive and we will keep adding content so the app can grow with your child's maths progression.",
      "q8": "How do I change or cancel my subscription?",
      "a8": "You can cancel or modify your subscription by logging in to your user on the Evolytes web platform.\n\nLog into the Evolytes monitor on this page, select the child you want to modify the billing information for. Go to settings, billing information and press modify subscription.",
      "q9": "What languages is Evolytes available in?",
      "a9": "Evolytes is available in Icelandic, English and French. \n\nEvolytes will soon be available in Swedish, Norwegian and German.",
      "q10": "Why is my Monitor empty?",
      "a10": "In order to the Evolytes monitor to show data your child needs to start playing the Evolytes mobile game. If still nothing is displayed it may be due to the fact that your not connected to the internet.",
      "q11": "Can I share my Monitor access with a parent or teacher?",
      "a11": "In order to share your access to a student with another parent, guardian or teacher you will need to send us an email at evolytes@evolytes.com and formally request that the data will be shared with another user. In order for us to process the request you will need to provide the following information:\n\nThe email used to log into Evolytes\nThe name of the child you want to share your access for\n\nThe email of the user you want to share access with.\n\nThe person whom you want to share your access to will receive an email so they can activate their account. They will then be able to visualize the students progress in the monitor and open the Evolytes mobile game with their credentials and select the child as an account to play.",
      "q12": "How does Evolytes adapt to my child's / student's level ?",
      "a12": "All of the answers your child provides while learning in Evolytes are used to assess its skill level. We will then adapt the content based on your child's strenghts and weaknesses.\n\nThe platform adapts the difficulty of the content based on your child's answers in real time. All children start with easy material which is then made harder based on the student's proficiency.\n\nChildren will keep getting questions for skills we know they have developed in order to develop long term skill acquisition and does not forget what they have learned previously. If the student starts to struggle with material they have mastered before they will have to practice it again and the question type associated with it will start being prompted more often again.",
